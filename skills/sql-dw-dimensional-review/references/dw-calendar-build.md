# DW Calendar Dimension Build Reference

Reference scripts for `Dimension.Calendar`, `Dimension.StatHolidays`, and the
`SSAS.v_Calendar` view. This is a **one-time build** (idempotent — safe to re-run).

**Design basis:** Adapted from the existing `dbo.Calendar` / `dbo.[LoadCalendar]` / `dbo.stat_holiday`
objects in the OLTP database.

| Aspect | OLTP (`dbo.Calendar`) | DW (`Dimension.Calendar`) |
|---|---|---|
| Primary key type | `DATE` (`DateKey DATE`) | `DATE` (`[Date Key] DATE`) — matches OLTP |
| Integer date surrogate | `YYYYMMDD` implicit in int columns | `[YYYYMMDD] INT` separate column; `[YYYYMM] CHAR(6)` |
| Unknown/sentinel rows | `'1753-01-01'` (min) / `'9999-12-31'` (max) | `'1900-01-01'` (unknown); `'9999-12-31'` (open/future) |
| Fact table FK type | `DATE` | `DATE` — FK columns match Calendar PK |
| Open event sentinel | `EndDate = '9999-12-31'` | `[End Date Key] = '9999-12-31'` |
| Load approach | `WHILE` loop (row-by-row) | Recursive CTE (set-based — 10–100× faster) |
| Column naming | camelCase / no spaces | Title Case with spaces — SSAS/Kimball convention |
| StatHolidays | `dbo.stat_holiday` (BC + audit cols) | `Dimension.StatHolidays` (simplified — no audit cols) |

**Fiscal year convention (org standard — confirmed from `dbo.LoadCalendar`):**
- Fiscal year = **starting** calendar year: **FY2024 = Apr 1, 2024 – Mar 31, 2025**
- `Fiscal Year = CASE WHEN MONTH >= 4 THEN YEAR ELSE YEAR - 1 END`
- Fiscal Period 1 = April, Fiscal Period 12 = March
- Week numbering: Sunday-start (`DATEFIRST 7`)

**Fact table date FK columns:** Because `[Date Key]` is `DATE`, all fact table date FK
columns (e.g., `[Date Key]`, `[Order Date Key]`, `[Ship Date Key]`) must also be `DATE`.
Use `'9999-12-31'` as the sentinel value for open/no-end events. Use `'1900-01-01'` for
unknown/null dates that must resolve to a Calendar row.

## 1. Dimension.StatHolidays Table

Stat holiday data is produced by the Nager.Date C# project (see Section 6 for
update notes). The project outputs a SQL `MERGE` script targeting this table.

```sql
IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM sys.tables t
    JOIN sys.schemas s ON t.schema_id = s.schema_id
    WHERE s.name = 'Dimension' AND t.name = 'StatHolidays'
)
BEGIN
    CREATE TABLE [Dimension].[StatHolidays] (
        [Stat Holiday Key]  INT           NOT NULL IDENTITY(1, 1),
        [Stat Holiday Date] DATE          NOT NULL,
        [Stat Holiday Name] NVARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
        CONSTRAINT [PK_Dimension_StatHolidays]
            PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED ([Stat Holiday Key]),
        CONSTRAINT [UQ_Dimension_StatHolidays_Date]
            UNIQUE NONCLUSTERED ([Stat Holiday Date])
    );
END
```

> **Note:** No separate `[Stat Holiday Date Key] INT` column. The table joins to
> `Dimension.Calendar` directly on `[Stat Holiday Date] = [Date Key]` (both `DATE`).
> BC holidays only — no Province Code column needed.

**Holiday generation — MERGE template** (output from updated StatHolidayGenerator):

```sql
MERGE [Dimension].[StatHolidays] AS [target]
USING (
    VALUES
        (CAST('2024-01-01' AS DATE), N'New Year''s Day'),
        (CAST('2024-02-19' AS DATE), N'Family Day'),
        (CAST('2024-03-29' AS DATE), N'Good Friday'),
        (CAST('2024-04-01' AS DATE), N'Easter Monday'),
        (CAST('2024-05-20' AS DATE), N'Victoria Day'),
        (CAST('2024-07-01' AS DATE), N'Canada Day'),
        (CAST('2024-08-05' AS DATE), N'BC Day'),
        (CAST('2024-09-02' AS DATE), N'Labour Day'),
        (CAST('2024-09-30' AS DATE), N'National Day for Truth and Reconciliation'),
        (CAST('2024-10-14' AS DATE), N'Thanksgiving Day'),
        (CAST('2024-11-11' AS DATE), N'Remembrance Day'),
        (CAST('2024-12-25' AS DATE), N'Christmas Day'),
        (CAST('2024-12-26' AS DATE), N'Boxing Day')
) AS [source] ([Stat Holiday Date], [Stat Holiday Name])
ON [target].[Stat Holiday Date] = [source].[Stat Holiday Date]
WHEN MATCHED THEN
    UPDATE SET [Stat Holiday Name] = [source].[Stat Holiday Name]
WHEN NOT MATCHED BY TARGET THEN
    INSERT ([Stat Holiday Date], [Stat Holiday Name])
    VALUES ([source].[Stat Holiday Date], [source].[Stat Holiday Name])
WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE THEN
    DELETE;
```

> **BC policy quirks:**
> - Easter Monday and Boxing Day are included even though they are not technically
>   BC statutory holidays — the org treats them as stats.
> - In-lieu: if a holiday falls on Saturday the prior Friday is the observed date;
>   if it falls on Sunday the following Monday is the observed date. The generator
>   outputs the *observed* date, not the actual date.

## 2. Dimension.Calendar Table

44 columns. `[Date Key]` is `DATE` (matches OLTP convention); integer representations
are available as `[YYYYMMDD]` (INT) and `[YYYYMM]` (CHAR(6)).

```sql

    SELECT 1 FROM sys.tables t
    JOIN sys.schemas s ON t.schema_id = s.schema_id

## 4. SSAS.v_Calendar View

This view adds volatile/relative columns that depend on `GETDATE()`. Keeping these
in the view (rather than the base table) avoids daily updates to `Dimension.Calendar`.

```sql
CREATE OR ALTER VIEW [SSAS].[v_Calendar]
AS
    SELECT
        -- ── Passthrough from Dimension.Calendar ───────────────────────────────────
        c.[Date Key],
        c.[YYYYMMDD],
        c.[YYYYMM],
        c.[Year],
        c.[Quarter],
        c.[Quarter Name],
        c.[Month],
        c.[Month Name],
        c.[Month Name Short],
        c.[Month Name First Letter],
        c.[Month Year],
        c.[Day],
        c.[Day Of Week],
        c.[Weekday Name],
        c.[Weekday Name Short],
        c.[Weekday Name First Letter],
        c.[Day Of Year],
        c.[Day Of Week In Month],
        c.[Day Of Week In Year],
        c.[Week Of Year],
        c.[Week Of Month],
        c.[Is Weekday],
        c.[Is Weekend],
        c.[Fiscal Year],
        c.[Fiscal Year Name],
        c.[Fiscal Year Name Short],
        c.[Fiscal Quarter],
        c.[Fiscal Quarter Name],
        c.[Fiscal Period],
        c.[Fiscal Period Name],
        c.[First Date Of Month],
        c.[Last Date Of Month],
        c.[First Date Of Quarter],
        c.[Last Date Of Quarter],
        c.[First Date Of Year],
        c.[Last Date Of Year],
        c.[First Date Of Fiscal Year],
        c.[Last Date Of Fiscal Year],
        c.[Is Leap Year],
        c.[Days In Month],
        c.[Is Stat Holiday],
        c.[Stat Holiday Name],
        c.[Is Pay Week],

        -- ── Relative / current-date columns (volatile — computed from GETDATE()) ──
        CASE WHEN c.[Date Key] = CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END
                                                                AS [Is Today],
        CASE WHEN c.[YYYYMM] = CAST(YEAR(GETDATE()) * 100 + MONTH(GETDATE()) AS CHAR(6))
             THEN 1 ELSE 0 END                                  AS [Is Current Month],
        CASE WHEN c.[Fiscal Year] =
                    CASE WHEN MONTH(GETDATE()) >= 4
                         THEN YEAR(GETDATE())
                         ELSE YEAR(GETDATE()) - 1 END

        DATEDIFF(WEEK, c.[Date Key], CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE))   AS [Relative Week],
        DATEDIFF(MONTH, c.[Date Key], CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE))  AS [Relative Month]

    FROM [Dimension].[Calendar] c
    WHERE c.[Date Key] > '1900-01-01'   -- exclude unknown sentinel
      AND c.[Date Key] < '9999-12-31';  -- exclude open/future sentinel
GO
```

> **Sentinel row exclusion:** The view filters out both sentinel rows so SSAS only
> sees real dates. Reference the sentinels directly from `Dimension.Calendar` in ELT
> fact-load queries (e.g., `ISNULL([source].[OrderDate], '1900-01-01')` for unknown
> dates, `CAST('9999-12-31' AS DATE)` for open SCD Type 2 rows).

## 5. SSAS Tabular Configuration

### Date table declaration

After importing `SSAS.v_Calendar`, mark it as a Date table:

```
Mark as Date Table → Date Column: [Date Key]   (DATA TYPE must be Date — ✓)
```

`[Date Key]` is `DATE` type — SQL Server Analysis Services accepts `DATE` columns
directly as the date table key. No conversion needed.

### Sort-by columns

| Column | Sort By |
|---|---|
| `[Month Name]` | `[Month]` |
| `[Month Name Short]` | `[Month]` |
| `[Month Year]` | `[YYYYMM]` |
| `[Weekday Name]` | `[Day Of Week]` |
| `[Weekday Name Short]` | `[Day Of Week]` |
| `[Fiscal Period Name]` | `[Fiscal Period]` |
| `[Fiscal Quarter Name]` | `[Fiscal Quarter]` |
| `[Fiscal Year Name]` | `[Fiscal Year]` |
| `[Fiscal Year Name Short]` | `[Fiscal Year]` |
| `[Quarter Name]` | `[Quarter]` |

### Hidden columns (numeric keys used for sort-by only)

`[Month]`, `[Quarter]`, `[Day Of Week]`, `[Day Of Year]`, `[Week Of Year]`,
`[Day Of Week In Month]`, `[Day Of Week In Year]`, `[Week Of Month]`,
`[Fiscal Period]`, `[Fiscal Quarter]`, `[Fiscal Year]`,
`[YYYYMMDD]`, `[YYYYMM]`, `[Relative Day]`, `[Relative Week]`, `[Relative Month]`

### Display folders

| Folder | Columns |
|---|---|
| `Calendar\Year` | `[Year]`, `[Quarter]`, `[Quarter Name]`, `[Month]`, `[Month Name]`, `[Month Name Short]`, `[Month Year]`, `[Day]` |
| `Calendar\Week` | `[Week Of Year]`, `[Week Of Month]`, `[Day Of Week]`, `[Weekday Name]`, `[Weekday Name Short]` |
| `Calendar\Day Attributes` | `[Day Of Year]`, `[Day Of Week In Month]`, `[Day Of Week In Year]`, `[Is Weekday]`, `[Is Weekend]`, `[Is Leap Year]`, `[Days In Month]` |
| `Calendar\Period Boundaries` | `[First Date Of Month]`, `[Last Date Of Month]`, `[First Date Of Quarter]`, `[Last Date Of Quarter]`, `[First Date Of Year]`, `[Last Date Of Year]` |
| `Fiscal\Year` | `[Fiscal Year]`, `[Fiscal Year Name]`, `[Fiscal Year Name Short]`, `[Fiscal Quarter]`, `[Fiscal Quarter Name]`, `[Fiscal Period]`, `[Fiscal Period Name]` |
| `Fiscal\Period Boundaries` | `[First Date Of Fiscal Year]`, `[Last Date Of Fiscal Year]` |
| `Relative` | `[Is Today]`, `[Is Current Month]`, `[Is Current Fiscal Year]`, `[Relative Day]`, `[Relative Week]`, `[Relative Month]` |
| `Holidays & Payroll` | `[Is Stat Holiday]`, `[Stat Holiday Name]`, `[Is Pay Week]` |
| `Labels` | `[Month Name First Letter]`, `[Weekday Name First Letter]`, `[Month Name Short]`, `[Weekday Name Short]` |

### Time intelligence

Because `[Date Key]` is `DATE` type, standard SSAS time intelligence functions
(`DATEADD`, `DATESYTD`, `DATESQTD`, `DATESINPERIOD`, etc.) work without any
additional configuration.

## 6. StatHolidayGenerator Update Notes

The C# project at `src\dev\Database\StatHolidayGenerator` needs the following
changes before it can generate the full 2000–2050 range targeting `Dimension.StatHolidays`.

### Required changes

| Area | Current state | Required state |
|---|---|---|
| .NET target | .NET 6 | .NET 8 |
| Nager.Date version | 1.46.0 | 3.x |
| API class | `HolidayClient` (removed in v3) | `DateSystem` static class |
| Date range | 2023–2042 | 2000–2050 |
| Output path | Hardcoded `C:\Temp\holidays.sql` | CLI argument `args[0]` |
| Target table | `[dbo].[stat_holiday]` | `[Dimension].[StatHolidays]` |
| Province filter | `countryCode = "CA"`, filter `provinceCode = "BC"` | `DateSystem.GetPublicHolidays(year, "CA")` then filter `Subdivisions.Contains("CA-BC")` |
| Easter Monday / Boxing Day | Custom additions | Still required — add manually if Nager omits them |
| In-lieu logic | Custom Saturday/Sunday → weekday shift | Keep as-is (already correct) |

### New API pattern (Nager.Date 3.x)

```csharp
using Nager.Date;

var holidays = DateSystem.GetPublicHolidays(year, "CA")
    .Where(h => h.SubdivisionCodes == null
             || h.SubdivisionCodes.Contains("CA-BC"))
    .OrderBy(h => h.Date)
    .ToList();
```

### MERGE target change

Output file header changes from:
```sql
MERGE [dbo].[stat_holiday] AS [target]
```
to:
```sql
MERGE [Dimension].[StatHolidays] AS [target]
USING (VALUES ...) AS [source] ([Stat Holiday Date], [Stat Holiday Name])
ON [target].[Stat Holiday Date] = [source].[Stat Holiday Date]
```

> Note: The join is now on `DATE` type. No integer date key column needed.

## 8. Deployment Checklist

```
[ ] 1. Populate Dimension.StatHolidays first (MERGE from updated generator output)
[ ] 2. Execute Dimension.PopulateCalendar
[ ] 3. Validate row count: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Dimension.Calendar  → expect 18,628 + 2 sentinels
[ ] 4. Verify sentinel rows present:
        SELECT [Date Key] FROM Dimension.Calendar
        WHERE [Date Key] IN ('1900-01-01', '9999-12-31')
[ ] 5. Spot-check fiscal year labels:
        SELECT [Date Key], [Fiscal Year], [Fiscal Year Name], [Fiscal Period]
        FROM Dimension.Calendar
        WHERE [Date Key] IN ('2024-03-31', '2024-04-01', '2025-03-31', '2025-04-01')
[ ] 6. Validate stat holidays:
        SELECT [Date Key], [Is Stat Holiday], [Stat Holiday Name]
        FROM Dimension.Calendar
        WHERE [Is Stat Holiday] = 1 AND YEAR([Date Key]) = 2024
        ORDER BY [Date Key]
[ ] 7. Validate pay weeks:
        SELECT TOP 10 [Date Key], [Is Pay Week] FROM Dimension.Calendar
        WHERE [Is Pay Week] = 1 ORDER BY [Date Key]
[ ] 8. Check YYYYMMDD and YYYYMM:
        SELECT [Date Key], [YYYYMMDD], [YYYYMM]
        FROM Dimension.Calendar
        WHERE [Date Key] IN ('2024-04-15', '2025-01-01')
[ ] 9. Import SSAS.v_Calendar into SSAS Tabular model
[ ] 10. Mark as Date Table → Date Column: [Date Key]
[ ] 11. Configure sort-by columns (see Section 5)
[ ] 12. Hide numeric key columns (see Section 5)
[ ] 13. Arrange into display folders (see Section 5)
[ ] 14. Verify time intelligence functions work in DAX (e.g., TOTALYTD, DATEADD)
```
